Hi, I am Xue-Ni Hou, received my MSc from China Agriculture University in 2016, then joined the group of Prof. Hidehito Tochio and received my Ph.D. from Kyoto University (Japan) in Sept 2021. Happy to join Tang Lab from Dec 2021. I am now continuing my research on the conformational states of biomacromolecules.
