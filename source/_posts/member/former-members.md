Hi, I’m Chen Jingru, I completed my undergraduate study in physics at Central China Normal University, and now I am studying for a PhD at Peking University. Tanglab is a laboratory full of passion, creativity and love, I’m going to be a hot-wired, heat-seeking person, riding the wave, pushing the envelope in a sea of interdisciplinary subjects. I will make every effort to perform my duty, make my own contribution, and grow with Tanglab family side by side.
